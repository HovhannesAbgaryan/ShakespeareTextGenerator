ACT I
SCENE I. London. The palace.
Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others
KING HENRY IV:
So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
KING HENRY IV:
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
KING HENRY IV:
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
KING HENRY IV:
To be commenced in strands afar remote.
